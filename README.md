# Academic_Projects

The projects I made during my courses at Ko√ß university

Ball Balancer file contains a control system implementation on MATLAB with the help of Simulink. This project was done for MECH 304, Dynamic Modeling and Control, course.

Burgers Equation, Flow Around a Bluff-Body and ... folders contain MATLAB implementation of different fluid flow problems. Those projects was done for MECH 422, Computational Fluid Dynamics course.

Writing Initials folder contain a MATLAB implementation for a robot arm movement. Robot arm follows a predefined path using the Newtonian Method.
